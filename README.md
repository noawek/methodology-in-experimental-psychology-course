# Methodology in Experimental Psychology - Final Project 📊🧠
Welcome to the repository for my final project in the Methodology in Experimental Psychology course! This project includes an experiment I designed, as well as an accompanying research paper that explores the question:
"Does high physiological arousal lead to perceiving others as more attractive?" 💓✨

Using R, I conducted statistical analyses on the data collected during the experiment, applying advanced methods learned in the course to showcase my research and analytical skills.

Project Overview 🔍

This project aimed to investigate whether individuals experiencing higher levels of physiological arousal are more likely to perceive others as attractive. 
The study involved:
- Designing an experiment to induce varying levels of physiological arousal.
- Collecting and processing participant data.
- Analyzing results using statistical methods in R to test hypotheses.

Key Highlights 📈 
- Experiment Design: Created a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis, collecting data from real participants.
- R Analysis: Used R for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- Statistical Techniques: Applied methods like t-tests, ANOVA, and regression to examine relationships between arousal and attractiveness ratings.
- Results: Findings provide insights into the link between physiological states and perception, contributing to understanding psychological and emotional influences on judgment.

Skills and Tools Used 🛠️
- R Programming: For data analysis and visualization.
- Statistical Analysis: Inferential and descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing.
- Data Visualization: Plots and graphs to effectively present findings.
